# Hi there 👋 I'm Max, an aspiring Software and Machine Learning Engineer!

<!-- ![hello-max](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136573648-ac04751d-056c-40dd-8fa8-f445645cd93c.png?s=0.5) -->

<img src="hello-max.png" width="199" title="Hello!"/>

I am currently studying Mathematics ➕ Computer Science at Durham University 🎓 under the Natural Sciences program. 
> Within Natural Sciences, you are able to choose exactly what modules you study, from whichever faculties you choose, thereby removing many of the restrictions from "normal" degrees -

> it is a build-your-own-degree degree and allows you to freely pursue your curiosities within your chosen fields! I would highly recommend. For example, it has allowed me to complete both a Bachelor's and a Master's level Dissertation/Project in Computer Science which normally students are not allowed to do (as it uses too many university resources)!

I am in my 4th year and due to obtain my MSci (Master of Science) in Mathematics and Computer Science in August 2022!

# My Career 💻:
> For more details on my roles, and non-software-engineering-specific experiences, see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-woolterton/).
### IBM - Jun 2021: 

> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/000000/ibm.png"/>

* Extreme Blue Intern - 3 months
### Durham University - Sep 2020:
> <img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Durham_University_Logo.png" height="96"/>

* Computer Science Demonstrator / Teaching Assistant - 2 years:
    * I run three weekly Programming Paradigms Practical groups. During these sessions I teach and assist a group of (~10) second year university students to write code in C, Java and Haskell (depending on the week/group in question).
### Lanterne - Jun 2020:
> <img src="https://lanterne.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logo_colours-1024x251.png" height="96"/>
* Data Science Consultant - 5 mos:
    * Main Projects:
        - Working on the discovery, scouting and subsequent analysis of the applicability of various data sources to be integrated into global footfall/busyness prediction models ~ 3 months.
        - Started up and have since been managing Lanterne's open-source Opening Hours retrieval project [poi-info-scraper](https://github.com/SebasMueller/poi-info-scraper/). Subsequently built upon the open-source codebase internally to increase its global coverage drastically, by integrating it with a hybrid Bing and Yelp scraper I built, to then be integrated directly into our AWS pipeline ~ 1.5 months.

* Machine Learning Consultant - 3 mos:
    * After having been offered a promotion towards the end of my summer of work at Lanterne, I began alongside a small team of Agile Data Scientists during my first term of 3rd year at Durham University. During this time, I was primarily applying Deep Learning to construct a Convolutional Neural Network to forecast mobile location data throughout the UK to be used in global footfall/busyness prediction models (Crowdless). For an example of the work I undertook, see my fork of [ST-ResNet-Pytorch](https://github.com/shadowbourne/ST-ResNet-Pytorch).
