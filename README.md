# My University Degree 🎓:

I am currently studying Mathematics ➕ Computer Science at Durham University 🎓 under the Natural Sciences program. 
> Within Natural Sciences, you are able to choose exactly what modules you study, from whichever faculties you choose, thereby removing many of the restrictions from "normal" degrees -
> it is a build-your-own-degree degree and allows you to freely pursue your curiosities within your chosen fields! I would highly recommend. For example, it has allowed me to complete both a Bachelor's and a Master's level Dissertation/Project in Computer Science which normally students are not allowed to do (as it uses too many university resources)!

I am in my 4th year and due to obtain my MSci (Master of Science) in Mathematics and Computer Science in August 2022!

## Fourth Year 🏆 - In Progress:
### MSci Dissertation/Project:
* Zero-shot Image Classification: Teach AI to Recognise Unknown Things
### Computer Science (83% of year, including Dissertation):
* Natural Language Processing
* Advanced Computer Vision
* Parallel Scientific Computing II
* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

### Mathematics (17% of year):
* Mathematical Finance
## Third Year 🥉 - 1st (89/100):
>Prize for Outstanding Level 3 Achievement awarded by the Board of Examiners


### BSc Dissertation/Project:
* Combining Recent Advances in Reinforcement Learning for Super Mario Bros - [R2D4-RL](https://github.com/shadowbourne/R2D4-RL): 92 [PyTorch]
    > ![Gifdemo6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136659042-7b071648-e77a-4fef-9757-9160d22ae2b0.gif)
    > 
    > During my Dissertation, I surveyed the field of Reinforcement Learning and spent my project investigating how best to combine many recent advances from Reinforcement Learning. In doing so, I created an AI agent capable of teaching itself to play the game Super Mario Bros. to superhuman level, achieving new state-of-the-art performance within the field. This demo shows the agent playing Worlds 5 and 7, and was taken from the project's [final presentation](https://github.com/shadowbourne/R2D4-RL/blob/main/Demonstration%20Final%20Presentation.pptx).

### Computer Science (58% of year, including Dissertation):
* Deep Learning - [pegasus-lightweight-gan](https://github.com/shadowbourne/pegasus-lightweight-gan): 104/100 [PyTorch]
    > ![Gifdemo245](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136661179-7fd26891-5c75-4da2-829b-42bd29473d02.gif)
    > 
    >  The task was to create a Pegasus (a winged horse) by training generative models solely on a dataset (STL-10 or CIFAR-10) containing no winged horses. However, the datasets do contain some horses, birds and planes. After extensively experimenting with, designing and tweaking various [flow-based generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_generative_model) and [VAEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder) (variational autoencoders) (as these were theoretically better suited to the task and I wanted to try something novel), I decided to apply the current state-of-the-art [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (generative adversarial network) ["lightweight" GAN](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1Fqg133qRaI) to the task. Above you can see some interpolation within the latent space of a partially-trained model, and below you can see some of the final Pegasi I produced. Various of my Pegasi were used as exemplar feedback to the class.

* Reinforcement Learning - [R2ND4-Gravitar-RL](https://github.com/shadowbourne/R2ND4-Gravitar-RL): 100 [PyTorch]
    >![Gifdemo2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136660504-c89f9c89-41d3-4070-982f-23473bda3fcb.gif)
    >
    > We were tasked with creating a Reinforcement Learning agent to play the notoriously difficult Gravitar from the Atari-57 suite. I therefore decided to look for the current state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning model for Atari ([R2D2](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1lyTjAqYX)) and re-created it to the best I could with my limited hardware. I produced the best agent in the class, and my convergence graph was used as exemplar feedback to the cohort (one of two such graphs).

* Parallel Scientific Computing I - [multicore-n-planet-simulator](https://github.com/shadowbourne/multicore-n-planet-simulator): 90 [C++]
    > ![Gifdemo1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136667074-f1f25ed1-1a71-44f2-b94c-5503c86e52ec.gif)
    > 
    > Vectorized and multicore n-body simulator(s) written and extensively optimised in C++ for scalability to millions of particles/planets to be run on a single node of a supercomputer.

* Recommender Systems - [CACBCF-Recommender-System](https://github.com/shadowbourne/CACBCF-Recommender-System): 92
    > ![Gifdemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18665030/136662812-603df2df-1e27-4033-b75b-a84137aa5de3.gif)
    > 
    > I created a "Novel Context Aware Restaurant Recommender System Using Content-Boosted Collaborative Filtering" using a custom hybrid scheme on the Yelp Dataset. To interface with this Recommender System, I created a fully-fledged GUI where user can log in, register, submit new reviews and retrieve personalized restaurant recommendations using Content Aware Content-Boosted Collaborative Filtering. In simplified terms, the recommender would look for restaurants in your vicinity (**context-aware**, as the recommender interfaces with location services) that match the type of restaurants you like (**content-based**) and that are liked by others with similar tastes to you (**collaborative filtering**). Due to being highly optimized, the recommender can retrain itself almost instantly when a user submits a new review or on alteration to a prediction. This means the user can interact with the recommender and see the recommendations change in real-time.

# My Career 💻:
> For more details on my roles, and non-software-engineering-specific experiences, see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-woolterton/).
## IBM - Jun 2021: 

> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/000000/ibm.png"/>

* Extreme Blue Intern - 3 months:
    * Worked in an autonomous team of four students to design, prototype and deliver a solution to tackle a problem of our choice within the Retail Industry for a well-known fashion retailer using hybrid-cloud technology.
    * Despite reduced development time, I delivered a fully-fledged MVP and a business case to take forward to the CTO, of an idea that both the Retail Director and Head of Operations & Omnichannel Transformation expressed they thought had real promise within the industry.
    * IBM predicts our solution will save the company £37m p/a by halving customer returns and increasing customer loyalty.
    * Submitted a US patent application covering our algorithm.
    * I personally led the back-end Agile development team of David Shipman and myself, which required us to learn/use JavaScript/Node.js, Apollo-GraphQL, MongoDB and IBM Cloud Object Storage. This required envisioning any functionality that the front-end would need by completion and delegating tasks accordingly. I completed the back-end three weeks ahead of schedule. 
    * I then joined the front-end team, where I used React and Ionic to build a cross-platform customer-facing phone application.
    * Despite having never touched React or Ionic before, I quickly became the go-to member to solve the hardest React/Ionic bugs and blockers the team encountered. I was incredibly proud of this feat.
    * I also decided to integrate our back-end directly with the client's website for search and product functionality to exemplify to my client the "pluggability" and ease of integration of our design schema.
    * In week 4, our well-known grocery client pulled out. We therefore had to completely pivot on the past three weeks work and transfer the insights gained to a different sector. After an initial shock period, we iterated our Design Thinking to produce an even more impactful solution.
    * This was a valuable insight into the real world of working with clients whose needs may drastically change at a moment’s notice.
## Durham University - Sep 2020:
> <img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Durham_University_Logo.png" height="96"/>

* Computer Science Demonstrator / Teaching Assistant - 2 years:
    * I run three weekly Programming Paradigms Practical groups. During these sessions I teach and assist a group of (~10) second year university students to write code in C, Java and Haskell (depending on the week/group in question).
## Lanterne - Jun 2020:
> <img src="https://lanterne.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logo_colours-1024x251.png" height="96"/>
* Data Science Consultant - 5 mos:
    * Main Projects:
        - Working on the discovery, scouting and subsequent analysis of the applicability of various data sources to be integrated into global footfall/busyness prediction models ~ 3 months.
        - Started up and have since been managing Lanterne's open-source Opening Hours retrieval project [poi-info-scraper](https://github.com/SebasMueller/poi-info-scraper/). Subsequently built upon the open-source codebase internally to increase its global coverage drastically, by integrating it with a hybrid Bing and Yelp scraper I built, to then be integrated directly into our AWS pipeline ~ 1.5 months.

* Machine Learning Consultant - 3 mos:
    * After having been offered a promotion towards the end of my summer of work at Lanterne, I began alongside a small team of Agile Data Scientists during my first term of 3rd year at Durham University. During this time, I was primarily applying Deep Learning to construct a Convolutional Neural Network to forecast mobile location data throughout the UK to be used in global footfall/busyness prediction models (Crowdless). For an example of the work I undertook, see my fork of [ST-ResNet-Pytorch](https://github.com/shadowbourne/ST-ResNet-Pytorch).
